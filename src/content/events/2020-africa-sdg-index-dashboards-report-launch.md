Join the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) as we launch the 2020 Africa SDG Index & Dashboards Report. 

The report synthesizes the most recent, available data on the SDGs to support national and regional discussions on where each African country stands with respect to achieving the SDGs. 

Since it was first produced in 2018, this annual flagship report has provided the most up-to-date data to track and rank the performance of African countries on the SDGs. As an unofficial monitoring tool, the report is complementary to official efforts to monitor the SDGs.

It is a relevant tool to for all stakeholders at national level in order to identify priorities for action, understand key implementation challenges as well as track progress to ensure accountability and gaps closing to achieve the SDGs by 2030.
